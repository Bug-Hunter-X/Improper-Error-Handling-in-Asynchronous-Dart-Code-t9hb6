# Dart Asynchronous Error Handling Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code and provides a solution for more robust error handling.

The `bug.dart` file contains an example with basic error handling. The `bugSolution.dart` shows a more robust approach. The key improvement lies in more informative error messages and consideration of network request specifics.  Always ensure error messages clearly communicate what failed and provide enough information for debugging.
